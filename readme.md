# Ransomware Detection and Mitigation System Documentation

## Abstract

This project implements a comprehensive system for detecting and mitigating ransomware-like behavior in a Windows environment. It combines real-time file system monitoring, process behavior analysis, and automated response mechanisms to provide a research platform for studying ransomware defense strategies.

## Introduction

Ransomware attacks continue to pose significant threats to organizations worldwide. This project provides a controlled environment for studying ransomware behavior patterns and developing effective detection and mitigation strategies. The system implements multiple layers of defense, including:

- Real-time file system monitoring
- Process behavior analysis
- Automated backup systems
- Emergency mitigation responses

## Methodology

### Detection System

The detection module (`src/detection/detector.py`) implements multiple detection strategies:

1. File Operation Monitoring:
   - Tracks file modifications, creations, and deletions
   - Analyzes operation frequency and patterns
   - Identifies suspicious file extensions

2. Process Behavior Analysis:
   - Monitors CPU and memory usage
   - Tracks file system access patterns
   - Identifies suspicious process behavior

3. Threat Scoring:
   - Combines multiple indicators into a threat score
   - Uses weighted scoring system
   - Triggers responses based on threshold values

### Monitoring System

The monitoring module (`src/monitoring/monitor.py`) provides:

1. Real-time File System Monitoring:
   - Uses Windows API for file system events
   - Tracks all file operations
   - Maintains event history

2. Pattern Analysis:
   - Identifies suspicious patterns
   - Tracks operation frequency
   - Monitors file type changes

### Mitigation System

The mitigation module (`src/mitigation/mitigator.py`) implements:

1. Automated Backup System:
   - Regular incremental backups
   - Emergency backup triggers
   - Backup rotation management

2. Emergency Response:
   - Process termination
   - Network isolation
   - System notifications

## Working

1. The system continuously monitors specified directories for file system events.
2. Each event is analyzed for potential threats using multiple indicators.
3. A threat score is calculated based on current system behavior.
4. When threat levels exceed thresholds:
   - Emergency backups are created
   - Suspicious processes are terminated
   - Administrators are notified

## Research and Testing

Testing was conducted in controlled environments using:
- Windows 10/11 virtual machines
- Various file operation patterns
- Simulated encryption behaviors
- Process behavior analysis

Results showed effective detection of:
- Rapid file modifications
- Suspicious process behavior
- Unusual file access patterns
- Mass file operations

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates effective strategies for:
- Early detection of ransomware-like behavior
- Automated response mechanisms
- System protection through monitoring
- Data preservation through backup systems

Future improvements could include:
- Machine learning-based detection
- Network behavior analysis
- Advanced process isolation
- Cloud backup integration
